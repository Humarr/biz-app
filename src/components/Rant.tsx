        <p className="mb-6">
          You think passion pays the bills? Ask that one friend who's passionate about photography but can't even afford a tripod. Or your cousin who "loves baking" but has sold more banana bread to her WhatsApp status than to actual customers.

        <p className="mb-8 font-bold">
          Passion is a fuel. Not a GPS.

          So no.<br />
          You don't need to hustle harder.

          Because what most people call a "business" these days is really just:

          <li>Selling cheap crap from China</li>

          You know what I'm talking about:

          Where is the SKILL?<br />
          Where is the OFFER?<br />
          Where is the STRATEGY?

        <p className="mb-8 font-bold">
          But no â€” you think a logo, a fancy IG bio, and a few reels with trending audio equals a business?

          Please.

        <p className="mb-6">
          That's cosplay.<br />
          That's theatre.<br />
          That's pretending to be an entrepreneur because actual entrepreneurship is boring, ugly, and full of work.

          No.

          You'd find a working food stand, learn how they do it, and start small.

          Belief is useless without direction.

          What you need isn't motivational BS.
