          That means one of two things:
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You're either weirdly entertained by my aggressive typing style and can't stop reading...
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Or â€” and this is the more likely one â€” some little ember inside you is still glowing with this thought:
        </p>

        <div className="quote mb-8">
          "Maybe... just maybe... this thing could work for me."
        </div>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And to that I say:
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          Oh, you sweet, skeptical genius.<br />
          You're damn right it could.

        <p className="mb-8">
          But you won't know for sure until we open the box, will you?

        <p className="mb-8">
          So let's talk about what's actually inside this thing.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Not in a sales-y, cheesy, "and THAT'S not all!" kind of way.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          But in the way you'd want a smart, no-BS friend to break it down for you after whispering:
        </p>

        <div className="quote mb-8">
          "Bro. I found something. I think this is the one."
        </div>

        <h3 className="mb-6">
          First, what it is NOT:
        </h3>
        <ul className="mb-8 space-y-2 pl-6 list-disc">
          <li>It's not a "one-product-funnel formula."</li>
          <li>It's not a "high-ticket coaching blueprint."</li>
          <li>It's not a 10-hour Udemy course with 17 modules and a workbook you'll never touch.</li>
          <li>It's not filled with motivational fluff.</li>
          <li>It's not written for the guy with â‚¦2M in savings and a cousin who owns a printing press.</li>
          <li>And it sure as hell isn't another "Buy this, watch the magic happen" pitch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          No.
        </h2>

        <h1 className="mb-8 text-gradient">
          This is different.
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-6">
          This is a book.<br />
          But not just any book.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          It's a gloriously savage, 37-page, punch-you-in-the-face-with-reality manual for finally starting a business that doesn't ruin your life.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          And yes â€” it's short.<br />
          On purpose.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Because you don't need more info.<br />
          You need clarity. Direction. Action.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          You need someone to look you in the eye and say:
        </p>

        <div className="quote mb-8">
          "Yo. Stop wasting time. Here's what to do â€” and why."
        </div>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And then hand you the map, the compass, the backpack, AND a bottle of paracetamol for when your brain starts doubting itself again.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          The vibe?<br />
          Think:
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          If James Clear got drunk on espresso and started beefing with fake online gurus in your WhatsApp group...<br />
          ...and then wrote a business book so honest, your excuses would file for unemployment.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          It's not polite.<br />
          It's not sanitized.<br />
          It's not "inspirational."
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          It's liberating.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Because when you read it...
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          You'll start to see through the fog.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          You'll finally understand:

        <h3 className="mb-6">
          What does it give you?
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-8">
          Let me paint the picture.

            <span className="text-[rgb(var(--accent))] mr-2">ðŸ“Œ</span>

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And best of all?

        <div className="bg-note rounded-xl p-6 mb-8 border-l-4 border-accent">
          <h3 className="text-accent mb-4">ðŸ“Œ</h3>

        <p className="mb-8">
          But wait... why just a book?
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          Because a book is:

        <p className="mb-8">
          Just YOU.<br />
          A PDF.<br />
          And a reality check that could spark the most profitable era of your life.

          Now here's where it gets fun.

          Remember earlier when I told you this thing was dangerously underpriced?

          Well...

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          I wasn't joking.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          The price of this 37-page tactical nuke of a guide?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Is so low, you'll probably scroll back up to make sure you read it right.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          But don't let the price fool you.

          What you're paying for?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Is a shortcut through years of trial, error, overthinking, starting the wrong things, quitting, restarting, repeating, spiraling...<br />

        <div className="quote mb-8">

        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">

          <li>"Copywriting" without an offer</li>

          <li>"Branding" without cashflow</li>
          <li>"Learning" without applying</li>
          <li>And following people who had no idea what they were doing either</li>

        <p className="mb-8">
          You are ONE decision away from skipping all that.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Not because this book is magic.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          But because it's the clearest starting point you've ever seen.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          And I made it short on purpose.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          So you can read it in one sitting.<br />
          Close it.<br />
          And start. Immediately.

        <p className="mb-8">
          So.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          That's what's inside.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          But you haven't even seen the bonuses yet.<br />
          (Hint: They are ridiculously good. And yes, they're real.)
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You haven't seen the guarantee I put on this thing.<br />
          (It's stupid generous. Like, probably-too-generous.)
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And you haven't yet felt that little rush you get when you actually take action on something that makes sense.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Which means we're almost at the moment of truth.

        <h3 className="mb-8">
          Next up?
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-6">
          I'm gonna lay the whole thing out.<br />
          The full offer.<br />
          The bonuses.<br />
          The price.<br />
          The guarantee.<br />
