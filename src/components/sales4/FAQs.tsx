            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Q1: Why should I pay â‚¦4500 when there's free advice on YouTube?</h3>
            <p>
              Because that free advice is why you're still broke.
              <br />
              This book isn't "content." It's a wake-up slap from someone who's made the mistakes, burned the money, and lived to write a brutally honest roadmap that works.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Q2 */}
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Q2: What makes this different from all the other eBooks I've wasted money on?</h3>
            <p>
              This book isn't pretending to be a business blueprint, success story, or "secret strategy."
              <br />
              It's a raw breakdown of what actually works when you have â‚¦3k, zero followers, and no daddy sponsorship.
              <br />
              Every word is built to hit â€” not to impress.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Q3 */}
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Q3: Is this about affiliate marketing, dropshipping, freelancing, or what?</h3>
            <p>
              Wrong question.
              <br />
              This book teaches first principles â€” the way to think, filter, and execute regardless of the trend.
              <br />
              You'll walk away knowing exactly what to sell, how to find buyers fast, and how to build momentum â€” whether you do services, products, info, or middleman gigs.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Q4 */}
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Q4: Do I need a laptop?</h3>
            <p>
              Nope.
              <br />
              You need a â‚¦0-to-â‚¦3k hustle mindset, a basic phone, and the ability to follow instructions that might make you uncomfortable... but rich.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Q5 */}
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Q5: Is this book just motivational fluff?</h3>
            <p>
              No.
              <br />
              It's the opposite.
              <br />
              It might demotivate you at first â€” because you'll realize how much time you've wasted.
              <br />
              But then it kicks your brain into gear and shows you exactly what to do next.
            </p>

          {/* Q6 */}
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Q6: What if I don't have any business idea yet?</h3>
            <p>
              Perfect.
              <br />
              You won't just be handed "ideas" â€” you'll learn how to think like a cash-hungry problem-solver, and generate your own hustle that fits your exact reality.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Q7 */}
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Q7: Will this work if I live in [insert country here]?</h3>
            <p>
              Unless your country bans thinking, selling, or having internet...
              <br />
              Yes.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Q8 */}
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Q8: Can't I just watch some TikToks and figure this out on my own?</h3>
            <p>
              Sure.
              <br />
              Waste another 6 months chasing trends from 19-year-olds who haven't even paid rent yet.
              <br />
              Or... you read one clear, ruthless book that ends the cycle in 2 hours.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Q9 */}
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Q9: Does this work for physical businesses too?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes.
              <br />
              Whether you're frying puff-puff or selling online courses â€” the psychology of real sales, positioning, and reinvestment stays the same.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Q10 */}
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Q10: Is there a guarantee?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes.
              <br />
              If this book doesn't hit hard and shift your thinking â€” even a little â€” send an email.
              <br />
              Get your money back.
              <br />
              No drama. No form-filling.
              <br />
              You don't even need a reason.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Q11 */}
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Q11: Is this beginner-friendly?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes.
              <br />
              In fact, it's designed for angry beginners â€” the kind who've bought 5 things, tried 3 "businesses," and still feel stuck.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Q12 */}
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Q12: I've been scammed before. How do I know this isn't more of the same?</h3>
            <p>
              You don't.
              <br />
              But scammers usually sell you dreams.
              <br />
              This book sells you reality.
              <br />
              You can feel the difference by the tone.
              <br />
              No hype. No false hope. Just facts that work.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Q13: I don't have time right now.</h3>
            <p>
              It's 37 pages.
              <br />
              You'll read longer arguments on Twitter.
              <br />
              One evening. One sitting. Done.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Q14 */}
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Q14: Will I actually make money from this?</h3>
            <p>
              Not if you read it like entertainment.
              <br />
              But if you apply even 30% of what's inside?
              <br />
              You'll stop bleeding time, energy, and ideas â€” and finally build something real.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Q15 */}
          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Q15: I'm still not sure.</h3>
            <p>
              Then don't buy it.
              <br />
              This book isn't for "maybe" people.
              <br />
              It's for people who've had enough.
              <br />
              When that's you?
              <br />
              You'll know.
