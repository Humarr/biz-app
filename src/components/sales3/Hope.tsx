        <p className="mb-8">
          You're still here.

          You read all that raw, flame-throwing honesty about fake gurus, passive income fantasies, and all the Instagram business cosplay...

        <p className="mb-8">
          ...and something inside you didn't flinch.

          Instead?
        </h3>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          It leaned forward.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Not because you like pain (although, hey — who am I to judge?).
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          But because you recognize truth when you hear it.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Somewhere deep in your gut — past the doubt, the fear, the overwhelm — something whispered:
        </p>

        <div className="quote mb-8">
          "They're talking about me."

        <h2 className="mb-6">
          You're not stupid.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You're not lazy.<br />
          You're not unmotivated.<br />
          You're not "just not cut out for business."
        </p>

        <h3 className="mb-8">
          You were just never taught how to start it properly.
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Nobody gave you the real roadmap.<br />
          Nobody warned you of the traps.<br />
          Nobody gave you a system that respects the fact that:
        </p>

        <ul className="mb-8 space-y-2 pl-6 list-disc">
          <li>You don't have unlimited time.</li>
          <li>Or money.</li>
          <li>Or a sugar daddy.</li>
          <li>Or rich friends who casually lend you ₦1.5M "to test this idea."</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-8">
          You're building from ground zero.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          So your path is going to look DIFFERENT.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Slower.<br />
          Smarter.<br />
          Cleaner.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And guess what?
        </p>

        <h1 className="mb-8 text-gradient">
          That's actually a massive advantage.
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Because when you have no fluff to hide behind — no fake brand, no startup capital, no shiny "six-figure funnel" — you're forced to face the real stuff that moves the needle.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Like:
        </p>

        <ul className="mb-8 space-y-3 text-xl">
          <li>Understanding human psychology and why people buy</li>
          <li>Crafting offers people actually want (not just what you want to sell)</li>
          <li>Selling without being scammy</li>
          <li>Marketing without needing a "reels schedule" or Canva templates</li>
          <li>Making your first ₦10k, then your first ₦50k, and scaling from there</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          One step at a time.<br />
          No illusions.<br />
          No delusions.<br />
          Just a clear, proven, real-world path.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And here's the part most people don't tell you:
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          You don't need a "business idea" to start.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-8">
          You don't need to have it all figured out.
        </p>

        <h3 className="mb-8">
          You just need to know what to do FIRST.
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Because momentum is the most powerful force in business.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Once you get that first ₦10k from something you created...
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          You change.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Forever.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You go from:
        </p>

        <div className="quote mb-8">
          "Maybe this can work"
        </div>

        <p className="mb-6">
          to
        </p>

        <div className="quote mb-8">
          "Holy crap. I just made money with my brain."
        </div>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You stop consuming content like a junkie.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You stop panicking every time someone drops a "new method."
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          You develop business immunity.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And eventually?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You find your feet.<br />
          You find your voice.<br />
          You find your own way.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          But you've gotta start differently.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          You've gotta start from reality.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And the truth is?
        </p>

        <h1 className="mb-8 text-gradient">
          You're better off than you think.
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You already have what it takes to make this work:
        </p>

        <ul className="mb-8 space-y-3 text-xl">
          <li>You've got hunger.</li>
          <li>You've got taste — you know when something is off.</li>
          <li>You've got pain — and pain is the best teacher.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And now?
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          You've got something else:
        </h2>

        <h1 className="mb-8 text-gradient">
          A weapon.
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-6">
          A weapon most people never get their hands on.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          It's not just a book.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          It's a business exorcism.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          It's a bullsh*t filter.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          It's the last thing you'll need to read before you stop listening to everyone and finally, FINALLY do this thing right.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Because here's the hope you've been waiting for:
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          You can start a business that works...
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Even if you have zero ideas.<br />
          Even if you've failed before.<br />
          Even if you're scared, confused, and burnt out.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          You just need a roadmap designed for real people — not rich kids, not fake entrepreneurs, not trust-fund dropouts trying to teach you "high-ticket closing."
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          You need something that says:
        </p>

        <div className="quote mb-8">
          "Here. Start HERE. And this time... don't skip the hard parts."
        </div>

        <p className="mb-8">
          This is that.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          You've found it.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And yeah, maybe this is all sounding a little too good to be true.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          So I'll leave you with one last story.
        </p>

        <h1 className="mb-8 text-gradient">
          THE MOMENT EVERYTHING SHIFTED
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-6">
          I remember this guy I met once.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          He wasn't anything special.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          No followers.<br />
          No money.<br />
          No clue.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          He was thinking of "starting a YouTube channel" and "maybe importing something from China" and "possibly doing a training for parents on how to get their kids into coding."
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          In short?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          He was everywhere.<br />
          Floating.<br />
          Stuck.<br />
          Smart — but spinning in circles.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And one day I told him:
        </p>

        <div className="quote mb-8">
          "You don't have a business problem. You have a decision problem."
        </div>

        <p className="mb-6">
          We sat down.<br />
          Tore up every fake idea.<br />
          Got brutally honest.<br />
          And built ONE tiny offer.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          One.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And two weeks later?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          He made his first ₦14,000.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          I know. It's not a Lamborghini.<br />
          But for him?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          It was everything.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Because suddenly, he KNEW it was possible.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          He wasn't watching success anymore.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          He was in it.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And now?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          He's never gone back.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          This can be your story.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Not by wishing.
        </p>

        <h3 className="mb-8">
          But by deciding.
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And your first decision is this:
        </p>

        <h1 className="mb-8 text-gradient">
          Read the book.
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Because once you do...
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You'll finally understand what they never taught you in school, in webinars, in motivational YouTube videos.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You'll get the truth.<br />
          The path.<br />
          The plan.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And most importantly:
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          You'll get your life back.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Because this whole time, you thought you were failing at business.
        </p>

        <h3 className="mb-8">
          But really?
        </h3>

        <h1 className="text-gradient">
          Business was failing YOU.
