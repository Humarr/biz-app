          ‚Ç¶4,500 can't even buy you a decent plate of shawarma anymore.

        <p className="mb-4">
          But it can buy you a savage business guide that might stop you from wasting 3 YEARS running around in circles with ‚Ç¶0 in your bank account, wondering why your 'WhatsApp biz' hasn't taken off.

          This isn't motivation.<br />
          It's provocation.<br />

          Perfect.
