          Let's be brutally honest for a second.<br />

          You want to start a business.<br />
          You've probably tried to start one.<br />

          Let's rewind to your first attempt.

        <p className="mb-6">
          You were excited. You watched some YouTube guru with a beard and a British accent tell you "anyone can do this."<br />
          And so you did it.

        <div className="card mb-6">
          <p>
            You created a Canva logo.<br />
            Picked a cute name.<br />
            Posted that launch graphic with dramatic music and the words:<br />
            <span className="font-bold">"We are live!"</span>
          </p>
        </div>
        <p className="mb-6">

          <p className="font-bold">
            Until day two.

        <p className="mb-6">
          When the only person who liked your post was your cousin that owed you ₦2K.<br />
          And your first DM was from some clown saying:<br />
          <span className="font-bold">"How much for exposure?"</span>
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold text-xl text-accent mb-6">
          Cue the spiral.

          <li>You tweaked the logo.</li>

        <div className="accent-block mb-6">
          <p>
            Inspirational quotes.<br />
            Random carousels.<br />
            5-second reels.<br />
            Motivational nonsense you don't even believe — all just to seem "consistent."

          But every time you post, the only response you get is your own echo.

          Yeah. That.

          Still... you kept going.<br />
          Because they said it's "a long-term game."<br />
          They said to trust the process.<br />
          They said the algorithm will eventually reward you.

          It didn't.

        <p className="mb-6">
          You got tired.<br />
          You got broke.<br />
          And you got close to deleting your account and blaming it all on "Nigeria's economy."

            But deep down... you know that's not the full story.

            Because people are making money out here.<br />
            Your guy from school just bought an iPhone 14.<br />
            That girl who says "DM for your cake needs" just posted three orders in one day.<br />
            And meanwhile you? Still stuck. Still "planning." Still hoping someone will drop money in your lap like manna.

        <p className="font-bold text-2xl text-center text-accent mb-6">
          Let me tell you why this keeps happening:
        </p>
        <p className="text-center font-bold text-3xl mb-6">
          You were lied to.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          You were taught to build a business like a celebrity, not a business owner.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          You thought it's about branding.<br />
          And "niching down."<br />
          And building a "know, like, and trust factor."
        </p>
        <p className="text-center font-bold text-xl text-accent mb-6">
          Lmao.
        </p>
        <div className="card mb-6">
          <p className="font-bold">
            Let me break it to you gently:<br />
            Nobody cares about your logo.<br />
            Nobody wants your 12-slide carousels.<br />
            And definitely, definitely nobody wants to "support your hustle" just because you're a nice person.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-bold text-xl text-accent">
            They only care about one thing:

            Can you solve a real problem they actually have... in a way they understand... and are willing to pay for?

            That's it.

        <p className="mb-6">
          And until you learn to do just that, you'll stay in that ugly cycle:

        <div className="bonus-card mb-6">
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>→ You try to launch something</li>

            <li>→ You tell yourself "I just need better content"</li>
            <li>→ Still crickets</li>
            <li>→ You start second-guessing your idea</li>
            <li>→ You give up</li>
            <li>→ You find a new "hot" idea</li>
            <li>→ Repeat</li>

          Now, let's go even deeper.

          You know what this cycle really does?
        </p>
        <p className="text-center font-bold text-2xl text-accent mb-6">
          It starts to eat at you.

          Not just your money.<br />
          Not just your time.<br />
          It eats at your belief.
        </p>
        <div className="accent-block mb-6">
          <p className="font-bold">
            Because nothing destroys your self-worth faster than trying your best and still getting ignored.

        </div>
        <p className="mb-6">
          You start to wonder if you're not cut out for business.<br />
          You start thinking maybe you're not "built for this."

        <p className="mb-6">
          Meanwhile, on Instagram, someone with a British accent is screaming about "abundance mindset" while selling a ₦90K course teaching people how to post on LinkedIn.

          It's enough to make you want to disappear.
