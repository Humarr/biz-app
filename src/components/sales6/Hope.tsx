          So I tore your dreams into shreds in the last section.

          Fair.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mb-6">
          But let's talk about something now that nobody has told you in a while:
        </p>
        <div className="text-box-accent text-center mb-6">
          <p className="font-bold text-2xl">
            It's not your fault.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Yeah, I know that's the classic cliché before some shady guru tries to sell you healing crystals or a course called "Activate Your Inner Boss Energy."
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold text-xl text-accent mb-6">
          But I mean it.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          You were trying.<br />
          You just weren't shown how to try smart.
        </p>
        <div className="card mb-6">
          <p className="font-bold">
            You weren't dumb — you were in the dark.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            They threw you into the middle of a maze with no map and said "figure it out."
          </p>
        </div>
        <p className="mb-6">
          And every time you took a wrong turn, someone shouted from the sidelines:
        </p>
        <div className="scribble-note mb-6">
          <p>"You're just not hungry enough!"<br />
          "You need to think bigger!"<br />
          "Your mindset is poor!"</p>
        </div>
        <p className="text-center font-bold text-xl text-accent mb-6">
          Excuse you?
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          You're already under pressure from rent, food, family expectations, NEPA's mood swings — and now someone who sells Canva templates is telling you it's your mindset?
        </p>
        <p className="text-center font-bold text-xl mb-6">
          Please.
        </p>

      <div className="mb-12">
        <p className="font-bold text-xl mb-6">
          Let me tell you the truth that nobody profits from telling you:
        </p>
        <div className="highlight-box mb-6">
          <p className="font-bold text-xl">
            You don't need to think bigger.<br />
            You need a simple, small win. Fast.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p className="mb-6">
          You need to feel like making money is possible.<br />
          You need your first ₦10,000.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold text-xl text-accent mb-6">
          Because once that hits your account, something inside you changes.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          It's like a switch flicks on.
        </p>
        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-6">
          <div className="p-6 border border-accent rounded-lg">
            <p className="font-bold">"Will this even work for me?"</p>
          </div>
          <div className="p-6 border border-accent rounded-lg bg-accent text-white">
            <p className="font-bold">"Ohhh... I see it now."</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p className="font-bold text-xl mb-6">
          And once you see it...<br />
          You can't unsee it.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          You start walking differently.<br />
          Talking differently.<br />
          Your confidence grows teeth.
        </p>
        <p className="text-center font-bold text-xl mb-6">
          And all the noise starts sounding... silly.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          You don't get hyped up by motivational quotes anymore — because you've tasted what it feels like to earn without begging.
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <div className="mb-12">
        <p className="font-bold text-xl mb-6">
          So let me show you the real hope here.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Not false hope.<br />
          Not hype.<br />
          Just possibility you can touch.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold text-xl text-accent mb-6">
          Let me paint a picture:
        </p>
        <div className="bonus-card mb-6">
          <p className="mb-4">
            You wake up this Saturday.<br />
            Not for a webinar.<br />
            Not to post some "entrepreneur life" story on WhatsApp.
          </p>
          <p className="font-bold">
            No. You wake up because you've got 2 people who messaged you overnight:
          </p>
          <div className="accent-block mt-4">
            <p className="font-bold">"Hi... I saw what you posted yesterday. I think I need this. How much is it?"</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p className="text-center font-bold text-xl mb-6">
          That's the dopamine hit right there.
        </p>
        <p className="text-center mb-6">
          Not views.<br />
          Not likes.<br />
          Not engagement.
        </p>
        <p className="text-center font-bold text-2xl text-accent mb-6">
          Money.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          ₦10K. ₦15K. Maybe more.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Not from selling a kidney.<br />
          Not from "referring 3 friends."<br />
          Not from memorizing a script that makes you sound like a scammer.
        </p>
        <div className="card mb-6">
          <p className="font-bold text-center">
            But from something real.<br />
            Something that solves a simple problem.<br />
            Something you put together with what you already know, or can figure out quickly.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p className="mb-6">
          No tech headache.<br />
          No 50-step funnel.<br />
          No "build an audience first."
        </p>
        <p className="text-center font-bold text-2xl mb-6">
          Just value in. Money out.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold text-xl text-accent mb-6">
          And when that happens — when you make your first ₦10K from your brain — something inside you clicks.

        <div className="scribble-note mb-6">
          <p>"Wait... this didn't even require a fancy logo."<br />
          "I didn't need to register an LLC before I made money."<br />
          "I didn't need a mentor screaming in my face."</p>

      <div className="mb-12">
        <p className="mb-6">
          All you needed... was a real system.<br />
          A map.<br />
          A cheat code for decoding the business game without playing pretend.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold text-xl text-accent mb-6">
          And that's what this book gives you.

            This isn't a motivational manifesto.<br />
            This isn't a content strategy guide.<br />
            This isn't a "how to become an influencer" crash course.

          <p className="mt-4 font-bold text-xl text-accent">
            It's a ₦4,500 slap-in-the-face roadmap to get you out of survival mode.

          It doesn't promise to make you rich in 7 days.<br />

          And more importantly — it'll show you how to do it again and again, on your own terms.

          No gatekeepers.<br />
          No pretending.<br />
