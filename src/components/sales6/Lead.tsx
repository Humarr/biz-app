            They just... paid you.<br />
            Like a normal business transaction.<br />
            Because you offered something they actually wanted. In a way that made sense.

          <li>Where every YouTube video promises you'll "make $1,000 a day" but somehow you're still broke... in three currencies</li>

          There's a way to actually do that.<br />
          To start a business — online, physical, hybrid, whatever — and have it actually bring in money in less than a week.

        <div className="subtle-note mb-6">
          <p>
            No complicated funnels.<br />
            No "brand building" nonsense.<br />
            No dancing on TikTok like a confused backup dancer.

          Just simple, proven, Nigerian-street-smart strategy...<br />
