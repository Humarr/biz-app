          You're in a crummy room with a blinking bulb that's been threatening to die for two weeks.<br />
          You're hunched over your phone.<br />
          Tabs open:

        <p className="mb-6">
          Tired.<br />
          Frustrated.<br />
          Half-hopeful, half-hating yourself for being hopeful.

          You've tried things before. Small things. Maybe big things.<br />
          They didn't work.

          You asked people for help — they ghosted.<br />
          You tried learning from courses — they overwhelmed.<br />
          You Googled — and drowned.

          And now, here you are again...<br />
          Scrolling.<br />
          Looking.<br />

          Now hold that scene.

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          Because we're about to flip it inside out.

          Same room.<br />
          Same bulb (you still haven't changed it. Typical.)

          But something's different.

          You're checking your Notion dashboard where your small but mighty offer just crossed ₦85,000 in total sales.

          You're sipping that Milo like it's Dom Pérignon.<br />

        <p className="mb-6">
          You look at your phone — no more "get-rich-quick" gurus in your feed. You unfollowed all of them.<br />

          You laugh now — not out of pain or bitterness — but because you see through the nonsense.

          You know how to spot BS in five words or less.

          You know when someone's faking the life they're teaching.

          <li>A clear offer</li>
          <li>A reason to wake up</li>

          <li>A plan that doesn't feel like anxiety dressed as "hustle"</li>
          <li>And a taste of financial independence that actually feels sustainable</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          It's not perfect.<br />
          But it's real.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          You went from "scattered" to "sharpened."<br />
          From "I'm just researching" to "I'm executing."

        <p className="mb-8">
          From "I need to make money" to "I know how I make money."

          From running around like a chicken with 37 Chrome tabs open...

        <p className="mb-8">
          To having a clear, confidence-infused system that builds real momentum.

          This is the power of transformation.

          Not the kind that's sold in 3-minute ads by some guy standing in front of a whiteboard drawing circles around the word "Leverage."

        <p className="mb-8">
          But the kind that comes from:

          <li>Facing the brutal truth</li>
          <li>Choosing a new path</li>

          <li>And watching the dominos fall from there</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Because here's the thing:

          You don't go from broke to Benz overnight.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You go from lost → to clarity<br />
          Clarity → to first sale<br />
          First sale → to confidence<br />
          Confidence → to consistency<br />
          Consistency → to scaling<br />

          You want freedom?

          Options are freedom.

          And options come when you stop spinning the "How do I start?" wheel of death...

          ...and finally say:

          "I'm done pretending. I'm doing this RIGHT."

          It's not just money.<br />
          Yeah, we'll talk money.

          Because you deserve to earn from your skills.

          But what's more powerful?

          The shift inside you.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          When you start waking up with ideas instead of dread.

        <p className="mb-6">
          When you stop second-guessing yourself every damn step.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          When you can look someone in the eye and say:

          "I run my own thing. I built it. I know what I'm doing."

          Even if it's not a million-naira business (yet)...<br />
          It's yours.
        </p>

          And nothing beats that.

        <p className="mb-8">
          So let's rewind the reel again. Final time.

        <p className="mb-6">
          You started out confused.<br />
          Tired.<br />
          Stuck.

          Now you've:

        <ul className="mb-8 space-y-3 text-xl">
          <li>Found your footing</li>
          <li>Built a tiny, mighty offer</li>
          <li>Launched without needing a fancy website</li>
          <li>Sold your first product or service</li>
          <li>Created a system you can repeat, tweak, and scale</li>
          <li>Gotten your own money flowing (without begging friends to buy)</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-8">
          But best of all?
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          You're no longer drowning in the shallow pool of "content inspiration."

          You're now deep in the ocean of execution.
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Where the real sharks swim.<br />

        <p className="mb-8">
          And it all started with one uncomfortable, punchy, painfully honest decision:

          You read a book that told you the truth.
