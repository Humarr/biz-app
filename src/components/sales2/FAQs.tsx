            <div className="bg-note p-4 rounded-lg">
              <h4 className="font-bold">Q1: Be honest. Is this just another "YouTube thread turned PDF" like the garbage I've wasted money on before?</h4>
              <p className="mt-2">A: No, fam. This isn't some AI-generated, ChatGPT-spit-out nonsense dressed up with Canva covers and vibes. This is a blood-soaked battle rant from someone who's been broke, confused, tired, and done with the fake guru circle-jerk. Every page drips with real talk, tested truths, and business strategy that hits like a slap from your future successful self.</p>
            </div>

            {/* Q2 */}
            <div className="bg-note p-4 rounded-lg">
              <h4 className="font-bold">Q2: It's just 37 pages? Shouldn't it be longer?</h4>
              <p className="mt-2">A: Ah, so you want a 350-page novel of fluff, huh? Pages padded with motivational quotes, stories about Jeff Bezos in his garage, and "mindset" babble that never helped anybody build sh*t? This book is 37 pages of straight punches. No fat. No fillers. Just what works. If that sounds "too short," maybe you've been trained to love pain instead of results.</p>

              <p className="mt-2">A: Especially if you don't. This isn't some advanced funnel-optimization, "10X your ad ROI" crap for already-rich bros. This is ground zero strategy ‚Äî what to do when you're starting with only ‚Ç¶3k, a cracked phone, and way too many screenshots of failed ideas in your Notes app.</p>
            </div>

            {/* Q4 */}
            <div className="bg-note p-4 rounded-lg">
              <h4 className="font-bold">Q4: I've read books before. Nothing changed. Why will this be different?</h4>
              <p className="mt-2">A: Because this one doesn't try to "motivate" you. It grabs you by the shirt, slaps you with truth, and throws you into the arena. If you still do nothing after reading it, you'll feel so exposed, so roasted, so spiritually violated... you'll either cry, or finally get off your ass and sell something. Either way, you'll move.</p>

              <p className="mt-2">A: Then read it twice. This is for people exactly like you. It shows you how to make something out of absolutely nothing ‚Äî not by wishing or waiting, but by learning how to sell, serve, and survive. In fact, if you're broke broke? This ‚Ç¶4,500 might be the last "expense" you make... before you finally start making income.</p>

              <p className="mt-2">A: Look. Fear's valid. But do you know what's scarier? Another 12 months of "thinking about it." Another year of "almost starting." Another lap around the same cycle of frustration, fake confidence, and new shiny distractions. This book isn't magic. But it gives you the realest damn shot at breaking out. And that? That's worth braving a little fear.</p>
