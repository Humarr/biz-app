      <div className="container-narrow space-y-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-red-400">⚠️ THE OFFER TEASE</h2>

        <p>So now you know:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-4">
          <li>You’re not crazy.</li>
          <li>You’re not lazy.</li>
          <li>And no — you’re not “not trying hard enough.”</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You were simply never handed the <strong>real map</strong>.</p>

        <p>But imagine…</p>

        <p><em>Just imagine…</em></p>

        <p>
          What if that map <strong>already existed</strong>?<br />
          What if someone who’s been in your shoes — broke, pissed, fed up, and DONE with business advice from people with trust funds and soft hands — actually wrote down the playbook they wish they had when they were just trying to survive?
        </p>

        <p><strong>A battle manual</strong> written specifically for:</p>

        <ul className="list-none space-y-3 pl-2">
          <li>🔹 The guy who only has ₦2,850 left in his account and still hasn’t eaten</li>
          <li>🔹 The girl with 17 business ideas and a headache</li>
          <li>🔹 The angry, broke, data-hustling rebel who&apos;s tried EVERYTHING and still feels like a fraud</li>
          <li>🔹 The introvert who&apos;s sick of fake “build-in-public” people who never show their failure screenshots</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          No sugar-coating.<br />
          No funnels.<br />
          No “just visualize abundance” nonsense.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Just pure, strategy-laced, street-smart business truth.</strong></p>

        <p>The kind that doesn’t pat you on the back…</p>

        <p className="text-red-500 font-bold">
          It SLAPS you across the face — and yells:<br />
          “WAKE UP. <br />
          HERE’S WHAT TO DO. <br />
          NOW MOVE.”
        </p>

        <p>The kind of guide that makes you say:</p>

        <div className="quote text-lg font-semibold italic text-yellow-300">“Damn. This is what I’ve been looking for.”</div>

        <p>But here’s the twist:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>You won’t find it in a course.</li>
          <li>Or a webinar.</li>
          <li>Or buried under ten hours of someone’s podcast where they say “value” 67 times.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This thing?</p>

        <ul className="list-none space-y-2">
          <li>🔥 It’s short.</li>
          <li>🔥 It’s loud.</li>
          <li>🔥 It’s brutally honest.</li>
          <li>🔥 And it’s built for speed — not shelf decoration.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="font-medium">
          It’s not for everyone.<br />
          It’s not polite.<br />
          And if you’re still clinging to your romantic dreams of passive income without sweat?
        </p>

        <p className="text-red-400 font-bold text-lg">You should NOT read this.</p>

        <p>
          But if you’re tired…<br />
          If you’re furious…<br />
          If you’ve got that fire in your chest and you’re ready to go from broke to bold?
        </p>

        <p className="text-gradient text-xl font-bold">Then what you’re about to see next might just change everything.</p>

        <div className="mt-4">
          <p className="text-center font-semibold text-lg">Ready to meet your war manual?</p>
          <p className="text-center italic">Say the word.</p>
          <p className="text-center text-red-300 font-medium">(With gloves. It bites.)</p>
        </div>
      </div>
