          To smash every delusion, distraction, and fake-guru fantasy that’s keeping you poor.

        <p className="mb-6 text-lg font-headline2 uppercase text-primary">
          “Don’t Start a Business… Until You Read This 37-Page Rant.”
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 italic">
          (Yes. That’s the actual title. And yes — it means exactly what you think.)

        <p className="mb-6">
          It’s not “motivational.”<br />
          It’s not “inspirational.”<br />
          It’s not going to pet your head and whisper sweet six-figure dreams in your ear.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 font-bold">
          It’s a 37-page punch to the gut of everything you’ve been told about starting a business.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Inside, you’ll learn:

        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6 font-bold">
          Each page?<br />
          Designed to slap.<br />
          Every line?<br />
          Built to sell.<br />
          Every idea?<br />
          Something you can actually use. Today. This week. Now.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 font-bold text-accent text-2xl">
          And here’s the kicker:
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 text-xl font-headline2">
          It’s just ₦4,500.<br />
          That’s less than the price of your favorite shawarma, two bottles of Pepsi, and one emotionally damaging business course from Twitter that made you question your entire existence.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          And you get bonuses.<br />
          Real ones. Not “10 Canva templates” type nonsense.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 italic">
          (We’ll get to that in a second.)
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 font-bold">
          But here’s the truth:
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          If this rant doesn’t help you?<br />
          If it doesn’t wake something up inside you?<br />
          If you don’t learn anything that makes you go:
        </p>

        <blockquote className="quote mb-6">
          “HOW THE HELL HAVE I NEVER HEARD THIS BEFORE?”
        </blockquote>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Then email me.<br />
          I’ll give you your money back.<br />
          No stress. No long story.<br />
          Just a polite: “Thanks for trying it.”
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 font-bold">
          That’s how much I believe this thing will change the way you see business — and yourself.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 font-bold text-accent text-xl uppercase">
          So the only real question left is:
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 font-bold text-2xl">
          You in?<br />
          Or are you gonna keep letting people who’ve never been broke tell you how to win?
