          What if you're not lazy?<br />
          Not unmotivated.<br />
          Not "undisciplined."

        <h1 className="mb-8 text-gradient">
          What if you've just been given a map that leads nowhere?

          A map that says:

          God knows you've done that.

        <p className="mb-6">
          You've posted at midnight.<br />
          You've learned copywriting from carousels.<br />
          You've binged YouTube videos on "niche clarity" till your brain fried like suya.

        <p className="mb-8">
          But it's still not working.

          You're starting to believe it's your fault.

          You're not the problem.<br />
          The game is rigged against beginners.

          It's built to confuse you.<br />

          But it won't.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Because it's all noise.<br />
          All talk, no tactics.<br />
          All "build your brand" but no "how do I make my first ‚Ç¶10k this week without ads, a product, or a sugar daddy?"

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          So listen closely, because I'm about to break your brain in the best way:

          It is possible to start from zero...<br />
          With no followers...<br />
          No fancy tools...<br />
          No laptop...<br />
          Just you, a smartphone, and a bone-deep hunger not to die broke.

          You know how to find buyers.<br />
          You know how to speak their language.<br />

          You're flipping ‚Ç¶3k into ‚Ç¶30k.<br />

          And when people say:
