      <div className="container-narrow space-y-6">
        <h2>“Maybe… Just Maybe… You’re Not Broken. You’ve Just Been Building in the Dark.”</h2>

        <p>Let me ask you something dangerous:</p>

        <p><strong>What if you’re not lazy?<br />Not unmotivated.<br />Not “undisciplined.”</strong></p>

        <p>What if you’ve just been given a map that leads nowhere?</p>

        <div className="scribble-note">
          A map that says:<br /><br />
          “Start a brand. Build an audience. Post content. Be valuable. Wait.”
        </div>

        <p>And you’ve done that.<br />God knows you’ve done that.</p>

        <p>
          You’ve posted at midnight.<br />
          You’ve learned copywriting from carousels.<br />
          You’ve binged YouTube videos on “niche clarity” till your brain fried like suya.
        </p>

        <p>But it’s still not working.</p>

        <p>You’re tired.<br />You’re broke.<br />And worst of all…</p>

        <p><strong>You’re starting to believe it’s your fault.</strong></p>

        <p>But here’s the truth no one tells you:</p>

        <div className="scribble-note">
          You’re not the problem.<br />
          The game is rigged against beginners.
        </div>

        <p>
          It’s built to confuse you.<br />
          To overload you with information.<br />
          To make you feel like just one more YouTube video will finally unlock the money gates.
        </p>

        <p>But it won’t.</p>

        <p>
          Because it’s all noise.<br />
          All talk, no tactics.<br />
          All “build your brand” but no “how do I make my first ₦10k this week without ads, a product, or a sugar daddy?”
        </p>

        <p><strong>So listen closely, because I’m about to break your brain in the best way:</strong></p>

        <div className="quote">
          It is possible to start from zero…<br />
          With no followers…<br />
          No fancy tools…<br />
          No laptop…<br />
          Just you, a smartphone, and a bone-deep hunger not to die broke.
        </div>

        <p><strong>It is possible to go from:</strong></p>

        <ul className="list-none space-y-2">
          <li><span className="highlight">❌</span> Endless trial and error</li>
          <li><span className="highlight">❌</span> 3 likes and your own mom ignoring your posts</li>
          <li><span className="highlight">❌</span> A “business” that’s just a logo and a dream</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>To:</strong></p>

        <ul className="list-none space-y-2">
          <li><span className="highlight">✅</span> Knowing exactly what to offer</li>
          <li><span className="highlight">✅</span> Making sales this week, not next year</li>
          <li><span className="highlight">✅</span> Actually having a game plan that makes sense, makes money, and makes you feel like you’re not crazy</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>It is possible.</strong></p>

        <p>And if you’re reading this?</p>

        <p><strong>You’re already halfway there.</strong></p>

        <p>Because the only thing worse than being broke and confused…</p>

        <div className="scribble-note">
          …is being broke, confused, and convinced it’s your fault.
        </div>

        <p><strong>So let me shine a little light for you, friend.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Picture this:</strong></p>

        <p>It’s 30 days from now.</p>

        <p>
          You’re not just surviving.<br />
          You’re not just “posting and praying.”<br />
          You’re making money. Real money.
        </p>

        <p>
          You know how to find buyers.<br />
          You know how to speak their language.<br />
          You know how to sell without sounding desperate or fake.
        </p>

        <p>
          You’re flipping ₦3k into ₦30k.<br />
          Then ₦30k into ₦300k.<br />
          And you’re doing it with scrappy, no-fluff tactics that work in the real world — not in some guru’s overpriced course.
        </p>

        <p>And when people say:</p>

        <div className="quote">“So what do you do?”</div>

        <p>
          You don’t stumble.<br />
          You don’t squint like a confused duck and say, “Uhmm… I help people unlock their potential?”
        </p>

        <p><strong>You smile and say:</strong></p>

        <div className="scribble-note">
          “I help [real audience] get [real result] — and I’m booked this week.”
        </div>

        <p>And it’s true.</p>

        <p><strong>Because now you’re no longer in the dark.</strong></p>

        <p>
          That future?<br />
          It’s not fantasy.<br />
          It’s not delusion.<br />
          It’s not “overnight success.”
        </p>

        <p className="text-gradient font-bold text-lg">
          It’s the result of finally doing things the way they actually work.
        </p>

        <p><strong>And I’m about to show you how.</strong></p>
      </div>
    </section>
