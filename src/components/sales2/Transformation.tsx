            It starts the way it starts for most of us:

          <p className="mb-4">
            You got the itch.<br />
            Maybe you hated your job. Maybe you just wanted freedom.<br />
            Or maybe you were just sick of hearing, "So what are you doing with your life?"
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            So you thought:

          <div className="quote mb-4">
            "Let me start something. Anything."

            You started watching business videos.<br />
            You downloaded someone's free PDF called "The Ultimate Online Business Blueprint."<br />
            You built a Notion page.<br />
            You wrote ideas in a dusty journal.<br />
            You tried dropshipping.<br />
            Then affiliate marketing.<br />
            Then freelancing.<br />
            Then that coaching thing your cousin's roommate's barber made â‚¦400k from in two weeks.

          <p className="mb-4">
            You dabbled. You switched. You burned.

          <p className="mb-4 font-bold">
            This crap doesn't work.<br />
            At least not for people starting with nothing.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Because nobody told you:

          <p className="mb-4">
            Your rent doesn't care if you're excited.<br />
            Your stomach doesn't get full off "vibes."<br />
            And your data is not gonna renew itself off "building a personal brand."

          <p className="mb-4">
            You start to wonder:

            "Is it me?<br />
