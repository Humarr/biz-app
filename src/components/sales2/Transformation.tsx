        <h2>From Broke, Confused & One Webinar Away From a Mental Breakdown…<br />To Selling Like a Street-Smart Genius With a Spine (and Money in the Bank)</h2>

        <p>Let me show you a tale.</p>

        <p>It’s not a fairy tale.</p>

        <p>It’s the real story of what happens when you stop listening to the chorus of business advice zombies...</p>

        <p>…and start building like someone who’s tired of being broke, ignored, and lied to.</p>

        <h3>👟 Act 1: The Wandering</h3>

        <p>It starts the way it starts for most of us:</p>

        <p>
          You got the itch.<br />
          Maybe you hated your job. Maybe you just wanted freedom.<br />
          Or maybe you were just sick of hearing, “So what are you doing with your life?”
        </p>

        <p>So you thought:</p>

        <div className="scribble-note">“Let me start something. Anything.”</div>

        <p>
          You started watching business videos.<br />
          You downloaded someone’s free PDF called “The Ultimate Online Business Blueprint.”<br />
          You built a Notion page.<br />
          You wrote ideas in a dusty journal.<br />
          You tried dropshipping.<br />
          Then affiliate marketing.<br />
          Then freelancing.<br />
          Then that coaching thing your cousin’s roommate’s barber made ₦400k from in two weeks.
        </p>

        <p>
          You dabbled. You switched. You burned.<br />
          You told people you were an “entrepreneur.”
        </p>

        <p>But inside?</p>

        <div className="quote">You were one Google search away from crying:<br />“Best businesses for broke introverts with no skills and only one bar of network.”</div>

        <h3>💀 Act 2: The Myth Shatters</h3>

        <p>Then came the realization:</p>

        <p>This crap doesn’t work.<br />At least not for people starting with nothing.</p>

        <p>Because nobody told you:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>What to sell</li>
          <li>Who to sell to</li>
          <li>Or even how the hell to test if your idea makes sense</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All you got were platitudes like:</p>

        <div className="scribble-note">
          “Just start.”<br />
          “Be consistent.”<br />
          “Pick a niche that excites you.”
        </div>

        <p>
          BUT BRO.<br />
          Your rent doesn’t care if you’re excited.<br />
          Your stomach doesn’t get full off “vibes.”<br />
          And your data is not gonna renew itself off “building a personal brand.”
        </p>

        <p>You start to wonder:</p>

        <div className="quote">“Is it me?<br />Am I just not cut out for this?”</div>

        <p>
          You feel ashamed.<br />
          Frustrated.<br />
          Lost.
        </p>

        <p>But then…</p>

        <p><strong>Something wild happens.</strong></p>

        <h3>💡 Act 3: The Awakening</h3>

        <p>You hear something different.</p>

        <p>Not motivational fluff.</p>

        <p>Not “You can do it, champ!”</p>

        <p>But real talk:</p>

        <div className="scribble-note">
          “You’re broke… because your business is broken.”<br />
          “Do NOT build a product yet. Test the damn thing.”<br />
          “You’re one stupid idea away from quitting forever — fix your idea pipeline.”<br />
          “Nobody wants what they need. Sell them what they want — then deliver what they need.”
        </div>

        <p>Suddenly, your brain goes:</p>

        <div className="quote">“Wait… wait wait wait… THAT makes sense.”</div>

        <p>And now?</p>

        <p>You’re angry — but in a good way.<br />Because you realize you’ve been sold dreams… when what you needed was strategy.</p>

        <p>You don’t want hope anymore.<br />You want instructions.</p>

        <h3>🚀 Act 4: The Rise</h3>

        <p>You ditch the “branding tips” and start learning real business moves:</p>

        <ul className="list-none space-y-2">
          <li><span className="highlight">✅</span> You discover the 4 Triggers that actually make people pay (and how to use them without sounding scammy)</li>
          <li><span className="highlight">✅</span> You finally understand how to test an idea in 3 days — not 3 months</li>
          <li><span className="highlight">✅</span> You learn to write ads that slap harder than Nigerian slippers (even with zero copywriting background)</li>
          <li><span className="highlight">✅</span> You create offers so good, people say “Take my money before I change my mind!”</li>
          <li><span className="highlight">✅</span> You stop undercharging because of “impostor syndrome” — and start pricing like a boss</li>
          <li><span className="highlight">✅</span> You learn where to advertise based on your offer, not your “platform preference”</li>
          <li><span className="highlight">✅</span> You get people talking about your product like it’s the second coming of jollof rice</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Every chapter? A blood-splattered stepping stone out of the mud.</p>

        <p>Every tactic? Battle-tested for broke beginners with no time to waste.</p>

        <p>You don’t feel overwhelmed anymore.</p>

        <p className="text-gradient font-bold text-lg">You feel dangerous.</p>

        <h3>💰 Act 5: The Transformation</h3>

        <p>Now, when people ask what you do…</p>

        <p>You don’t stutter.</p>

        <p>You don’t pretend to be busy.</p>

        <p>You tell them what you sell, who it helps, and how much it costs — without blinking.</p>

        <p>Because now…</p>

        <p>
          You know the game.<br />
          You know the rules.<br />
          You know where the money is — and how to get it.
        </p>

        <div className="scribble-note">
          You’re not “trying to build a business.”<br /><br />
          You’re running one.
        </div>

        <p>
          One that feeds you.<br />
          Fuels you.<br />
          Frees you.
        </p>

        <p>No more fluff.<br />No more fluffers.<br />No more playing small.</p>

        <div className="text-gradient font-bold text-lg">
          You started from zero…<br />
          Now you’re dangerous.
        </div>

        <p>And this?</p>

        <p>This whole transformation?</p>

        <p>
          Can be yours too.<br />
          But only if you’re done playing the “motivational content” game…<br />
          …and ready to build for real.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
