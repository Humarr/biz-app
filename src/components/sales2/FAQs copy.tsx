        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">
            ❓“₦4,500 for just 37 pages? Are you mad?”
          </h3>
          <p className="font-bold uppercase mb-2">ANSWER:</p>
          <p>Yes.</p>
          <p>
            Mad enough to condense decades of painful, bloody, trial-by-fire business lessons into a book you can
            finish in one sitting…
          </p>
          <p>…instead of a 500-page coma-inducing snoozefest padded with motivational diarrhea.</p>
          <p>Some people charge ₦50k for webinars that make you dumber.</p>
          <p>You’re complaining about ₦4,500 for actual clarity?</p>
          <p>If anything, it’s underpriced. But I want you to read it. Not admire it on your wishlist.</p>
        </div>

        {/* Question 2 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">
            ❓“Is this book for me if I haven’t started my business yet?”
          </h3>
          <p className="font-bold uppercase mb-2">ANSWER:</p>
          <p>That’s exactly who it’s for.</p>
          <p>
            This book is for the you who’s still unsure… still Googling “how to start a business in Nigeria” at 2AM…
          </p>
          <p>…still bouncing from idea to idea like a sugar-high rabbit.</p>
          <p>It’s for the you who’s sick of the fluff, but still doesn’t know what’s real.</p>
          <p>It’s for the you who doesn’t want to waste the next 2 years doing trial-and-error while pretending to be a “CEO” on Instagram.</p>
        </div>

        {/* Question 3 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">
            ❓“What if I already have a business?”
          </h3>
          <p className="font-bold uppercase mb-2">ANSWER:</p>
          <p>Great.</p>
          <p>Now go ask yourself:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-4">
            <li>Is your business making consistent money… or just collecting likes?</li>
            <li>Are you confident in your offer… or just copying what others are doing?</li>
            <li>Do you even have a real strategy… or just vibes and Canva graphics?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This rant will punch the weak points of your business model right in the teeth.</p>
          <p>And if everything in your business is already perfect? Congratulations. You probably don’t need this.</p>
          <p className="italic">(But I know you’re lying.)</p>
        </div>

        {/* Question 4 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">
            ❓“Is this one of those ebooks filled with vague advice like ‘add value’ and ‘just believe’?”
          </h3>
          <p className="font-bold uppercase mb-2">ANSWER:</p>
          <p>If I say “add value” in this book, it’s only because I’m mocking it.</p>
          <p>There are no vague theories in this book.</p>
          <p>Everything is:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-4">
            <li>Tactical</li>
            <li>Brutally honest</li>
            <li>Built for broke people who don’t have time to “discover their niche slowly through journaling and self-awareness”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You get advice like:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-4">
            <li>How to test if people will pay you BEFORE you build anything</li>
            <li>How to spy on competitors without feeling like a weirdo</li>
            <li>How to find your first offer TODAY without having a logo, followers, or even data</li>
          </ul>
          <p>No fluff. No waffle. No incense-burning manifestation exercises.</p>
        </div>

        {/* Question 5 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">❓“What if I don’t like the book?”</h3>
          <p className="font-bold uppercase mb-2">ANSWER:</p>
          <p>Simple.</p>
          <p>Email me and say: “This didn’t help me.”</p>
          <p>I’ll refund you.</p>
          <p>No form. No interrogation.</p>
          <p>I won’t even ask you to write an essay explaining your trauma.</p>
          <p>But you won’t ask for a refund.</p>
          <p>Because you’ll probably be too busy flipping through the pages and whispering “Damn…this guy’s spitting.”</p>
        </div>

        {/* Question 6 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">❓“Can I pay in dollars?”</h3>
          <p className="font-bold uppercase mb-2">ANSWER:</p>
          <p>Yes, boss.</p>
          <p>When you click the payment link, you’ll see an option to pay in dollars with your card.</p>
          <p>But why? You no like naira again?</p>
        </div>

        {/* Question 7 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">❓“Can I get a physical copy?”</h3>
          <p className="font-bold uppercase mb-2">ANSWER:</p>
          <p>At ₦4,500?</p>
          <p>You want me to print it, bind it, laminate it, wrap it in bubble wrap and send it through Lagos traffic to your doorstep?</p>
          <p>You don’t like peace, abi?</p>
          <p>No — this is a digital PDF. You get instant access. No waiting. No wahala. No dispatch rider saying “I'm five minutes away” for six hours.</p>
        </div>

        {/* Question 8 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">❓“What if I’m too broke to buy this?”</h3>
          <p className="font-bold uppercase mb-2">ANSWER:</p>
          <p>Then you need it the most.</p>
          <p>In fact, I wrote it for you.</p>
          <p>This isn’t one of those “you need capital to make capital” playbooks.</p>
          <p>This is:</p>
          <p>“You have ₦3k and zero hope? Cool. Let’s flip that ₦3k into ₦30k, then ₦300k.”</p>
          <p>There’s literally a bonus blueprint inside for that.</p>
          <p>If ₦4,500 is hard for you right now…</p>
          <p>Then trust me: the price of not reading this book will be way higher.</p>
          <p>That’s it.</p>
          <p>No more questions.</p>
          <p>Click below.</p>
          <p>Buy the book.</p>
          <p>Start the business that actually works — not the fantasy you’ve been sold.</p>

        {/* Question 9 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">
            Q1: Be honest. Is this just another “YouTube thread turned PDF” like the garbage I’ve wasted money on before?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A: No, fam. This isn’t some AI-generated, ChatGPT-spit-out nonsense dressed up with Canva covers and vibes. This is a blood-soaked battle rant from someone who’s been broke, confused, tired, and done with the fake guru circle-jerk. Every page drips with real talk, tested truths, and business strategy that hits like a slap from your future successful self.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Question 10 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">
            Q2: It’s just 37 pages? Shouldn’t it be longer?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A: Ah, so you want a 350-page novel of fluff, huh? Pages padded with motivational quotes, stories about Jeff Bezos in his garage, and “mindset” babble that never helped anybody build sh*t?
            This book is 37 pages of straight punches.
            No fat. No fillers. Just what works.
            If that sounds “too short,” maybe you’ve been trained to love pain instead of results.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Question 11 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">Q3: What if I don’t have a business yet? Is this still for me?</h3>
          <p>
            A: Especially if you don’t.
            This isn’t some advanced funnel-optimization, “10X your ad ROI” crap for already-rich bros.
            This is ground zero strategy — what to do when you’re starting with only ₦3k, a cracked phone, and way too many screenshots of failed ideas in your Notes app.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Question 12 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">
            Q4: I’ve read books before. Nothing changed. Why will this be different?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A: Because this one doesn’t try to “motivate” you.
            It grabs you by the shirt, slaps you with truth, and throws you into the arena.
            If you still do nothing after reading it, you’ll feel so exposed, so roasted, so spiritually violated…
            …you’ll either cry, or finally get off your ass and sell something.
            Either way, you’ll move.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Question 13 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">
            Q5: What if I’m broke broke? Like, my bank app is a horror movie.
          </h3>
          <p>
            A: Then read it twice.
            This is for people exactly like you.
            It shows you how to make something out of absolutely nothing — not by wishing or waiting, but by learning how to sell, serve, and survive.
            In fact, if you're broke broke?
            This ₦4,500 might be the last "expense" you make…
            …before you finally start making income.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Question 14 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">
            Q6: I’m scared. Like, what if I try again and still fail?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A: Look. Fear’s valid. But do you know what’s scarier?
            Another 12 months of “thinking about it.”
            Another year of “almost starting.”
            Another lap around the same cycle of frustration, fake confidence, and new shiny distractions.
            This book isn’t magic.
            But it gives you the realest damn shot at breaking out.
            And that? That’s worth braving a little fear.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Question 15 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">
            Q7: Can I get a refund if it sucks? Like, for real?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A: Yes. For real.
            If you read it and feel like it was a waste, just ask. No awkward silence. No 17-step refund form.
            Just shoot a message. Get your cash.
            No drama.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Question 16 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">Q8: I don’t like reading. Is there an audiobook?</h3>
          <p>
            A: Not yet. But the writing style is so vivid, blunt, and in-your-face that most people say it feels like getting yelled at by your brutally honest business friend.
            So yeah. You’ll survive.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Question 17 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">Q9: I have commitment issues. Can I just buy the bonuses instead?</h3>
          <p>
            A: LOL. No.
            The bonuses are like the elite squad — they only roll with the general.
            You get all 5 only with the book.
            No side deals. No black market.
            You want them? You commit. 😌
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Question 18 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="flex items-center gap-2 text-2xl font-bold">Q10: Who the hell are you again? Why should I trust you?</h3>
          <p>
            A: I’m not a guru. Not trying to be.
            I’m just someone who got sick of watching smart, broke, talented people fall for the same stupid traps.
            So I wrote a guide that I wish someone had given me before I wasted money, time, and hope.
            If you want pedigree, go stalk LinkedIn.
            If you want results, grab the damn book.

          <p>If you’re still on the fence after all this…</p>

          <p>The clock’s ticking. The price could go up. The regret will definitely catch up.</p>
