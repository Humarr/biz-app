        <h2>💀 PROBLEM STORY:<br />"You’re Not Lazy. You’re Just Drowning."</h2>

        <p>Let me tell you a sad little story.</p>

        <p>It starts like most of yours did.</p>

        <p>
          You were scrolling one night, minding your own business, when a slick-talking dude in a Tesla popped up and said:
        </p>

        <div className="quote">
          “You can start a 6-figure business with just your phone!”
        </div>

        <p>He had white teeth.<br />A MacBook.<br />Maybe even some biceps.</p>

        <p>He seemed like he knew what he was doing.<br />And he said you could do it too — “Just start!”</p>

        <p>So you did.</p>

        <p>You thought, “Okay, I’ll just start.”</p>

        <p>
          Maybe you picked a niche.<br />
          Maybe you created a page.<br />
          Maybe you bought a course, got a Canva subscription, registered an Instagram handle, joined a Telegram group, and typed “I’m ready boss 💪🔥” in the comments like a good soldier.
        </p>

        <p>And then?</p>

        <p>You waited.</p>

        <p>You posted.<br />You hashtagged.<br />You “added value.”</p>

        <p>And…nothing happened.</p>

        <p>No customers.<br />No sales.<br />Just anxiety.<br />Self-doubt.<br />And 14 PDF freebies from “Twitter money” bros cluttering your downloads folder.</p>

        <p><strong>Here’s the thing nobody tells you:</strong></p>

        <div className="scribble-note">
          “Just start” only works when you already have leverage.
        </div>

        <p>If you have:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>A rich uncle,</li>
          <li>A personal brand with 10k followers,</li>
          <li>Or a job that lets you fail comfortably…</li>
        </ul>

        <p>“Just start” is cute advice.</p>

        <p>But if you’re:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>Broke,</li>
          <li>Overwhelmed,</li>
          <li>And one bad decision away from giving up forever?</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>You need more than motivation. You need a MAP.</strong></p>

        <p>Because you’re not actually lazy.<br />You’re just disoriented.</p>

        <p>
          You’ve been force-fed a diet of half-baked tactics, aesthetic hustle reels, and productivity porn…
        </p>

        <p><strong>But no one told you what comes first.</strong></p>

        <p>No one told you:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>How to test your business idea without sinking money into it.</li>
          <li>How to know what’s worth selling.</li>
          <li>How to price like you mean it.</li>
          <li>How to avoid building another pretty business that makes ₦0.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>No one showed you the actual order of operations for going from “I’m broke” to “I’m profitable.”</p>

        <p>
          Instead, they tossed you into the jungle with a machete and a YouTube playlist…<br />
          …and told you to “trust the process.”
        </p>

        <p>
          And now?
        </p>

        <p>
          You’ve watched 27 hours of videos, subscribed to 11 newsletters, posted 17 times, made ₦3,250 in total…
        </p>

        <p>
          And somehow you’re still:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>Confused</li>
          <li>Tired</li>
          <li>Overthinking every move</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          And waking up with that sinking feeling in your chest:
        </p>

        <p className="italic">“Is it too late for me?”</p>

        <div className="scribble-note">
          No, it’s not too late.<br />
          But if you keep doing what you’re doing, it will be.
        </div>

        <p>
          Because the longer you stay in this spin-cycle of consumption, perfectionism, and chasing “the right idea”…<br />
          …the closer you get to burnout.
        </p>

        <p>
          The closer you get to quitting.
        </p>

        <p>
          The closer you get to crawling back to the same system you’re trying to escape.
        </p>

        <p>You know the one.</p>

        <p>
          The one where your worth is measured in degrees.<br />
          Where “business” is a pipe dream.<br />
          Where you’re told to be “realistic.”<br />
          Where you watch the same people who told you to “just start”…<br />
          …drive past you, laughing, in the car they bought selling dreams.
        </p>

        <p><strong>You ever feel like this whole thing — the dream of “starting your own thing” — was just a scam?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Like maybe success is just for other people?</strong></p>

        <div className="highlight">
          Here’s the twist no one tells you:
        </div>

        <p>
          You were never the problem.<br />
          Your process was.
        </p>

        <p>
          You’re not weak.<br />
          You’re not lazy.<br />
          You’re not “not cut out for this.”
        </p>

        <p>
          You’re just tired of wandering in the dark with no one giving you a flashlight.
        </p>

        <p><strong>That ends here.</strong></p>

        <p>
          Because once you understand how to build a business that actually makes money before it looks pretty,<br />
          once you understand the hidden triggers that make people buy,<br />
          once you know how to test, validate, position, and price like a damn professional…
        </p>

        <p><strong>It’s game over.</strong></p>

        <p>But you can’t get there if you’re still trapped in myth-land.</p>

        <p className="text-gradient font-bold">
          That’s what the next section is going to break.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Every lie. Every delusion. Every myth that’s keeping you broke.</strong></p>
      </div>
    </section>
