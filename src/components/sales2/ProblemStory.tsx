          ðŸ’€ PROBLEM STORY: "You're Not Lazy. You're Just Drowning."
        </div>

        <h2 className="mb-8">Let me tell you a sad little story.</h2>

        <p className="mb-8">
          It starts like most of yours did.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You were scrolling one night, minding your own business, when a slick-talking dude in a Tesla popped up and said:
        </p>

        <div className="quote mb-8">
          "You can start a 6-figure business with just your phone!"
        </div>

        <p className="mb-6">
          He had white teeth.<br />
          A MacBook.<br />
          Maybe even some biceps.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          He seemed like he knew what he was doing.<br />
          And he said you could do it too â€” "Just start!"
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          So you did.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You thought, "Okay, I'll just start."
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Maybe you picked a niche.<br />
          Maybe you created a page.<br />
          Maybe you bought a course, got a Canva subscription, registered an Instagram handle, joined a Telegram group, and typed "I'm ready boss ðŸ’ªðŸ”¥" in the comments like a good soldier.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And then?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You waited.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You posted.<br />
          You hashtagged.<br />
          You "added value."
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And...nothing happened.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          No customers.<br />
          No sales.<br />
          Just anxiety.<br />
          Self-doubt.<br />
          And 14 PDF freebies from "Twitter money" bros cluttering your downloads folder.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          Here's the thing nobody tells you:
        </h2>

        <div className="quote mb-8">
          "Just start" only works when you already have leverage.
        </div>

        <p className="mb-6">
          If you have:
        </p>

        <ul className="mb-8 space-y-2 pl-6 list-disc">
          <li>A rich uncle,</li>
          <li>A personal brand with 10k followers,</li>
          <li>Or a job that lets you fail comfortably...</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-8">
          "Just start" is cute advice.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          But if you're:
        </p>

        <ul className="mb-8 space-y-2 pl-6 list-disc">
          <li>Broke,</li>
          <li>Overwhelmed,</li>
          <li>And one bad decision away from giving up forever?</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 className="mb-8 text-gradient">
          You need more than motivation. You need a MAP.
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Because you're not actually lazy.<br />
          You're just disoriented.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You've been force-fed a diet of half-baked tactics, aesthetic hustle reels, and productivity porn...
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          But no one told you what comes first.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          No one told you:
        </p>

        <ul className="mb-8 space-y-3">

            How to avoid building another pretty business that makes â‚¦0.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-8">
          No one showed you the actual order of operations for going from "I'm broke" to "I'm profitable."
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Instead, they tossed you into the jungle with a machete and a YouTube playlist...
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          ...and told you to "trust the process."
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And now?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You've watched 27 hours of videos, subscribed to 11 newsletters, posted 17 times, made â‚¦3,250 in total...
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And somehow you're still:
        </p>

        <ul className="mb-8 space-y-2 pl-6 list-disc">
          <li>Confused</li>
          <li>Tired</li>
          <li>Overthinking every move</li>
          <li>And waking up with that sinking feeling in your chest:</li>
        </ul>

        <div className="quote mb-8">
          "Is it too late for me?"
        </div>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          Let me hit you with a truth bomb:
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          No, it's not too late.<br />
          But if you keep doing what you're doing, it will be.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Because the longer you stay in this spin-cycle of consumption, perfectionism, and chasing "the right idea"...
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          ...the closer you get to burnout.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          The closer you get to quitting.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          The closer you get to crawling back to the same system you're trying to escape.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You know the one.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          The one where your worth is measured in degrees.<br />
          Where "business" is a pipe dream.<br />
          Where you're told to be "realistic."<br />
          Where you watch the same people who told you to "just start"...
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          ...drive past you, laughing, in the car they bought selling dreams.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          You ever feel like this whole thing â€” the dream of "starting your own thing" â€” was just a scam?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Like maybe success is just for other people?
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          Here's the twist no one tells you:
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You were never the problem.<br />
          Your process was.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You're not weak.<br />
          You're not lazy.<br />
          You're not "not cut out for this."
        </p>

        <h1 className="mb-8 text-gradient">
          You're just tired of wandering in the dark with no one giving you a flashlight.
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-8">
          That ends here.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Because once you understand how to build a business that actually makes money before it looks pretty,<br />
          once you understand the hidden triggers that make people buy,<br />
          once you know how to test, validate, position, and price like a damn professional...
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          It's game over.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-8">
          But you can't get there if you're still trapped in myth-land.
