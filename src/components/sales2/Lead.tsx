        <p>Let’s get something out of the way.</p>

        <p>
          If you’re here for a feel-good, follow-your-dreams, “you got this!” motivational speech…
        </p>

        <p>Close this tab. Go listen to a podcast. Maybe do some breathwork.</p>

        <p>
          Because this ain’t a pep talk.<br />
          It’s an <span className="text-gradient">intervention.</span>
        </p>

        <p>You’ve been lied to.</p>
        <p>By ring-lighted fake gurus.</p>
        <p>By Twitter bros peddling recycled Stoicism.</p>
        <p>By your well-meaning friend who says “just start something.”</p>

        <p>Oh yeah?</p>
        <p>Tell that to your account balance.</p>
        <p>To the 12 unread “kind reminders” from your landlord.</p>
        <p>To the ache in your chest that motivation doesn’t touch.</p>

        <p>Let me guess…</p>
        <p>You’ve tried.</p>
        <p>Maybe started something.</p>
        <p>Maybe offered a service.</p>
        <p>Maybe posted three reels.</p>

        <p>Then?</p>
        <p>Crickets.</p>
        <p>Or pity DMs from friends who lowkey feel sorry for your hustle.</p>

        <p>And now, you’re wondering:</p>
        <p><em>“Maybe I’m just not cut out for this?”<br />“Maybe something’s wrong with me?”</em></p>

        <p>No.<br />There’s something wrong with the map you were given.</p>

        <p>You followed the “do what you love” crowd into a burning house.</p>
        <p>You listened to influencers who never started from scratch.</p>

        <p>But you?</p>
        <p>You don’t have capital.</p>
        <p>You don’t have an audience.</p>
        <p>You don’t have time to “find your passion.”</p>

        <p>
          You have ₦3k.<br />
          6GB of data.<br />
          And 17.5 units of patience left.
        </p>

        <p>
          You don’t need “clarity.”<br />
          You need results.<br />
          From what you already have.
        </p>

        <p>
          But no one’s showing you *that*.<br />
          They just keep saying:
        </p>

        <p>
          “Be consistent.”<br />
          “Deliver value.”<br />
          “Trust the process.”
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Bro… you <em>ARE</em> the process.</strong><br />
          And you’re about to combust.
        </p>

        <p>
          You don’t need another YouTube video.<br />
          You need someone to yank you out of the mud and say:
        </p>

        <div className="scribble-note">
          “Here’s what’s actually going on.<br />
          Here’s why it’s not working.<br />
          Here’s what to do — *today.*”
        </div>

        <p>This is that moment.</p>

        <p>
          An <span className="text-gradient font-bold">intervention</span> from someone who’s been just as broke, angry, and fed up.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don’t know if you’re ready.<br />
          But if you’ve read this far…
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>You’re exactly who this is for.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
