          Close this tab. Go listen to a podcast. Maybe do some breathwork.

        <p className="mb-8">
          Because this ain't a pep talk.<br />
          It's an intervention.

          You've been lied to.
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-6">
          By smiling fake gurus with ring lights.<br />
          By Twitter bros with rebranded Stoicism.<br />
          By your well-meaning friend who thinks "just start something" is actionable advice.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Oh, yeah?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Tell that to your account balance.<br />
          Tell that to the 12 unread "kind reminders" from your landlord.<br />
          Tell that to the hungry ache in your chest that motivation doesn't fill.
        </p>

        <h3 className="mb-8">
          Let me guess...
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You've tried.<br />
          Maybe started something.<br />
          Maybe offered a service.<br />
          Maybe posted three reels.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Then?<br />
          Crickets.<br />
          Or sympathy DMs from friends who lowkey pity your grind.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And now, you're sitting there wondering:
        </p>

        <div className="quote mb-8">
          "Am I just not cut out for this?<br />
          Is there something wrong with me?"

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          No.<br />
          There's something wrong with the map you were given.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You followed the "do what you love" crowd into a burning house.<br />
          You listened to influencers who never had to start from the bottom.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          But you?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You don't have capital.<br />
          You don't have an audience.<br />
          You don't have time to "find your passion."
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          You have ₦3k, 6GB of data, and exactly 17.5 units of patience left.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          You need results.<br />
          Now.<br />
          From whatever resources, skills, and scraps you already have.

        <p className="mb-8">
          But no one's showing you how to do that.<br />

          "Be consistent!"<br />
          "Deliver value!"<br />

        <p className="mb-8">
          Bro... you ARE the process right now.<br />
          And you're about to combust.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You don't need another YouTube video.<br />
          You need someone to pull you out of the swamp, wipe the motivational BS off your face, and say:
        </p>

        <div className="quote mb-8">
          "Here's what's really going on.<br />
          Here's why nothing has worked.<br />
          Here's what to do instead — today."

          So that's what this is.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          An intervention.

          I don't know if you'll be able to handle what's coming.<br />
