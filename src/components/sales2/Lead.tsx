        <p>Let’s get something out of the way:</p>
        <p>
          If you&apos;re here hoping for another feel-good, follow-your-dreams, you-can-do-it motivational speech…
        </p>
        <p>
          Close this tab. Go listen to a podcast. Maybe do some breathwork.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because this ain’t a pep talk.<br />
          It’s an <span className="text-gradient">intervention.</span>
        </p>
        <p>You’ve been lied to.</p>
        <p>By smiling fake gurus with ring lights.</p>
        <p>By Twitter bros with rebranded Stoicism.</p>
        <p>By your well-meaning friend who thinks “just start something” is actionable advice.</p>
        <p>Oh, yeah?</p>
        <p>Tell that to your account balance.</p>
        <p>Tell that to the 12 unread “kind reminders” from your landlord.</p>
        <p>Tell that to the hungry ache in your chest that motivation doesn’t fill.</p>
        <p>Let me guess...</p>
        <p>You’ve tried.</p>
        <p>Maybe started something.</p>
        <p>Maybe offered a service.</p>
        <p>Maybe posted three reels.</p>
        <p>Then?</p>
        <p>Crickets.</p>
        <p>Or sympathy DMs from friends who lowkey pity your grind.</p>
        <p>And now, you’re sitting there wondering:</p>
        <p><em>“Am I just not cut out for this?<br />Is there something wrong with me?”</em></p>
        <p>No.<br />There’s something wrong with the map you were given.</p>
        <p>You followed the “do what you love” crowd into a burning house.</p>
        <p>You listened to influencers who never had to start from the bottom.</p>
        <p>But you?</p>
        <p>You don’t have capital.</p>
        <p>You don’t have an audience.</p>
        <p>You don’t have time to “find your passion.”</p>
        <p>You have ₦3k, 6GB of data, and exactly 17.5 units of patience left.</p>
        <p>You need results.<br />Now.<br />From whatever resources, skills, and scraps you already have.</p>
        <p>But no one’s showing you how to do that.<br />They just keep saying:</p>
        <p>“Be consistent!”<br />“Deliver value!”<br />“Trust the process!”</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bro… you <em>ARE</em> the process right now.</strong><br />
          And you’re about to combust.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don’t need another YouTube video.<br />
          You need someone to pull you out of the swamp, wipe the motivational BS off your face, and say:
        </p>
        <div className="scribble-note">
          “Here’s what’s really going on.<br />
          Here’s why nothing has worked.<br />
          Here’s what to do instead — today.”
        </div>
        <p>So that’s what this is.</p>
        <p>An <span className="text-gradient font-bold">intervention.</span><br />
          From one frustrated, previously-broke, nearly gave-up-too human to another.</p>
        <p>I don’t know if you’ll be able to handle what’s coming.<br />
          But I do know this:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>If you’ve read this far...<br />You’re exactly who it’s for.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
