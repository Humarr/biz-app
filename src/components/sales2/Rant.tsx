          You were lied to.

        <p className="mb-6">

          You showed up.<br />
          Posted carousels.<br />
          Did voiceovers.<br />
          Reposted success quotes from men with $17k in credit card debt and a rented Benz in the background.

        <p className="mb-8">
          Because no one buys out of pity.<br />

        </h2>

        <h1 className="mb-8 text-gradient">
          You don't have it.
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Look, most beginner entrepreneurs (especially the honest ones like you) don't actually know what they're selling.

        <p className="mb-6">
          They think they do.<br />
          But they don't.

        <p className="mb-8">
          They're either:

        <ul className="mb-8 space-y-3">

            <span className="text-[rgb(var(--accent))] mr-2">‚Ä¢</span>
            Selling what they want to sell instead of what people actually want to buy,

            <span className="text-[rgb(var(--accent))] mr-2">‚Ä¢</span>
            Or doing this delusional "brand building" thing where they post content for free for 9 months in hopes that "authority" will magically turn into money.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-8">
          I'm not even judging.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          I did it too.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          I had my fair share of "Building in public" posts that got 7 likes and a prayer.<br />
          I "valued consistency" over conversion.<br />
          I read books, bought courses, joined WhatsApp groups full of lost souls nodding at each other's confusion.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          But here's what I learned the hard, bloody way:

        <div className="quote mb-8">
          Nobody pays you to be visible.<br />
          They pay you to be valuable.

        <p className="mb-8">
          And you can't be valuable if:
        </p>

        <ul className="mb-8 space-y-3">
          <li className="flex items-start">
            <span className="text-[rgb(var(--accent))] mr-2">‚Ä¢</span>
            You don't understand what the market is already paying for,
          </li>
          <li className="flex items-start">
            <span className="text-[rgb(var(--accent))] mr-2">‚Ä¢</span>
            You can't position your offer in a way that screams "TAKE MY MONEY",
          </li>
          <li className="flex items-start">
            <span className="text-[rgb(var(--accent))] mr-2">‚Ä¢</span>
            You don't even have a real offer ‚Äî just vibes and a Canva mood board.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          Let's talk about this "vibes" thing.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Because the number of "businesses" that are nothing but a pretty Instagram page with no value prop, no clear offer, and no pricing...
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          It's staggering.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          If I see one more page that says:

          And don't say "DM for pricing."<br />
          Don't say "custom packages."<br />
          Don't say "it depends."
        </p>

        <h3 className="mb-8">
          Say a number.<br />
          Say a result.<br />

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          It does.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Here's the thing:

        <h3 className="mb-8">
          Starting a business isn't hard.<br />
          It's just unforgiving.
        </h3>

        <p className="mb-6">
          It's not school.<br />
          There are no marks for effort.<br />
          No A for attendance.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          It's binary.
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Either people are paying you,<br />
          Or they're not.

          Now breathe.

        <p className="mb-8">
          Because I know that was a lot.

        <p className="mb-8">
          But someone had to say it.

        <p className="mb-8">
          Someone had to break the fake motivational fluff that's kept you running in circles for the last 6 months.

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          Here's what's true:

          You don't need a mentor.<br />
          You don't even need a product yet.

        <h2 className="mb-8">
          You need clarity, direction, and a framework.
        </h2>
