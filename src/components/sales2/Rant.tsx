        <h2>💢 RANT SECTION<br />“Motivation Is a Scam, and ‘Just Start’ Is the Devil’s Favorite Pickup Line”</h2>

        <p>Let’s go.</p>
        <p>No more baby gloves.<br />No more polite motivational quotes pasted on pastel backgrounds.<br />No more “Believe in yourself and everything will align.”</p>
        <p><strong>We’re going in raw.</strong></p>

        <p>Because at this point, you don’t need motivation.</p>
        <p>
          You need someone to drag your face into the cold, harsh mirror of truth and say:
        </p>

        <div className="scribble-note">
          “You’re not building a business.<br />
          You’re playing pretend.”
        </div>

        <p>Now wait—<br />Don’t clench your fists yet.</p>
        <p>I’m not attacking you.<br />I’m attacking what’s been done to you.</p>

        <p><strong>Let’s be real:</strong></p>

        <p>You were lied to.</p>

        <p>Fed a steady diet of:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>“Pick a niche”</li>
          <li>“Add value”</li>
          <li>“Be consistent”</li>
          <li>“Content is king”</li>
          <li>“Just show up every day and the universe will reward you!”</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And so you did.<br />You showed up.<br />Posted carousels.<br />Did voiceovers.<br />Reposted success quotes from men with $17k in credit card debt and a rented Benz in the background.</p>

        <p>And then you waited.</p>

        <p><em>…for what?<br />Divine intervention?</em></p>

        <p>Somebody sliding into your DMs with ₦100k and a desperate need for your 17-slide Canva post?</p>

        <p className="text-center text-3xl">💀</p>

        <p>It didn’t come.<br />It never does.</p>

        <p><strong>Because no one buys out of pity.<br />They buy out of clarity.</strong></p>

        <p>And here’s the punchline:</p>

        <p><strong>You don’t have it.</strong></p>

        <p>
          Look, most beginner entrepreneurs (especially the honest ones like you) don’t actually know what they’re selling.
        </p>
        <p>They think they do.<br />But they don’t.</p>

        <p>They’re either:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>Selling an “idea” instead of a result,</li>
          <li>Selling what they want to sell instead of what people actually want to buy,</li>
          <li>Or doing this delusional “brand building” thing where they post content for free for 9 months in hopes that “authority” will magically turn into money.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I’m not even judging.</p>
        <p>I did it too.</p>

        <p>
          I had my fair share of “Building in public” posts that got 7 likes and a prayer.<br />
          I “valued consistency” over conversion.<br />
          I read books, bought courses, joined WhatsApp groups full of lost souls nodding at each other’s confusion.
        </p>

        <p><strong>But here’s what I learned the hard, bloody way:</strong></p>

        <div className="scribble-note">
          Nobody pays you to be visible.<br />
          They pay you to be valuable.
        </div>

        <p>And you can’t be valuable if:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>You don’t understand what the market is already paying for,</li>
          <li>You can’t position your offer in a way that screams “TAKE MY MONEY”,</li>
          <li>You don’t even have a real offer — just vibes and a Canva mood board.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let’s talk about this “vibes” thing.</p>

        <p>
          Because the number of “businesses” that are nothing but a pretty Instagram page with no value prop, no clear offer, and no pricing…
        </p>

        <p><strong>It’s staggering.</strong></p>

        <p>
          If I see one more page that says:
        </p>

        <div className="quote">
          “Helping you unlock your potential through holistic wellness and digital transformation 🌱💻✨”
        </div>

        <p>I’m going to walk into the ocean.</p>

        <p className="text-center font-bold text-xl tracking-wide">
          WHAT.<br />DO.<br />YOU.<br />SELL?
        </p>

        <p>To who?<br />For how much?<br />With what result?</p>

        <p className="font-bold">
          And don’t say “DM for pricing.”<br />
          Don’t say “custom packages.”<br />
          Don’t say “it depends.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Say a number.<br />Say a result.<br />
          Say it like your rent depends on it — <strong>because guess what?</strong><br />
          It does.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Here’s the thing:</strong></p>

        <p>Starting a business isn’t hard.<br />It’s just unforgiving.</p>

        <p>It’s not school.<br />There are no marks for effort.<br />No A for attendance.</p>

        <p><strong>It’s binary.</strong></p>

        <p>
          Either people are paying you,<br />
          Or they’re not.
        </p>

        <p><strong>And if they’re not?</strong><br />It’s not their fault.<br />It’s yours.</p>

        <p className="text-center font-semibold">Now breathe.</p>

        <p>Because I know that was a lot.</p>
        <p><strong>But someone had to say it.</strong></p>

        <p>
          Someone had to break the fake motivational fluff that’s kept you running in circles for the last 6 months.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Here’s what’s true:</strong></p>

        <ul className="list-none space-y-3">
          <li><span className="highlight">❌</span> It’s not about building a brand first.</li>
          <li><span className="highlight">❌</span> It’s not about content calendars.</li>
          <li><span className="highlight">❌</span> It’s not about “niching down” until you disappear.</li>
          <li><span className="highlight">✅</span> It’s about solving a painful problem, for people who have money, in a way they understand and want to pay for.</li>
          <li><span className="highlight">✅</span> It’s about starting with the cash, then doing the cute stuff later.</li>
          <li><span className="highlight">✅</span> It’s about making sure your business survives before you start branding it like Coca-Cola.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          And no — you don’t need a huge following.<br />
          You don’t need to dance on TikTok.<br />
          You don’t need a mentor.<br />
          You don’t even need a product yet.
        </p>

        <p><strong>You need clarity, direction, and a framework.</strong></p>

        <p>Because you’ve already got what it takes.</p>
        <p><strong>You just haven’t been taught the real game.</strong></p>

        <p>
          And I mean the real game — the kind people who are actually making money don’t want to tell you because then they lose their fake guru power over you.
        </p>

        <p><strong>But guess what?</strong></p>

        <p>I’m not them.<br />And I’m not here to coddle you.</p>

        <p className="text-gradient font-bold">
          I’m here to shove you into the light like Rafiki did Simba in The Lion King.
        </p>

        <p><strong>You’ve been lied to long enough.</strong></p>

        <p className="text-xl font-bold">Now it’s time for some hope.<br />Some clarity.<br />Some real direction.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
