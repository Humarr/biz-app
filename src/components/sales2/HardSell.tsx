          Okay.

        <p className="mb-6">
          Let’s have a brutally honest moment here.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You’ve just spent the last few minutes:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Nodding at painfully accurate truths about why your business dreams haven’t left the group chat…</li>
          <li>Laughing nervously at how broke-confused-and-angry this whole “start something” thing really feels…</li>
          <li>Feeling that low-buzzing hum of “maybe this could actually help…” growing in your chest...</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          So now you’re at the fork in the road.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 font-bold">
          You can do what you’ve always done — which is:
        </p>

        <blockquote className="quote mb-6">
          “I’ll think about it.”<br />
          (Translation: “I’ll close this tab, open TikTok, then come back in 3 weeks when I’ve lost another ₦25k to a dumb business I wasn’t ready for.”)
        </blockquote>

        <p className="mb-6 font-bold">Or...</p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You can spend ₦4,500 today to get the unfiltered, unsanitized, “cut-the-BS” guide that was written for people just like you.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 font-bold">
          Not for rich tech bros.<br />
          Not for flexing fake-guru bastards.<br />
          Not for people with investors and ring lights and Canva team plans.<br />
          For YOU.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          The smart-but-stuck hustler who knows deep down…<br />
          that they’re not lazy, they’re just unarmed.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 font-bold">
          So here’s what happens when you click that button:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>You pay ₦4,500 (less than what you spend on 2 meat pies and Coke)</li>
          <li>You get Don’t Start a Business… Until You Read This 37-Page Rant delivered instantly</li>
          <li>You also get all 5 juicy bonuses that alone are worth 10x the price</li>
          <li>You finally get a roadmap that shows you what to do when your only capital is confusion, spite, and your last ₦2k</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Oh — and if it doesn’t help?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 font-bold">
          You get your money back.<br />
          No begging. No long story.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 font-bold">
          You’re not paying for information.<br />
          You’re paying for clarity.<br />
          For fire.<br />
          For a map.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 font-bold italic">
          And that… is priceless.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 font-bold">
          So here’s the deal.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You’ve come this far.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You’ve read this whole insane letter.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You felt it.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You know this is what you need.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 font-bold">
          So don’t let that old voice — the one that always finds a way to hesitate — win again.
