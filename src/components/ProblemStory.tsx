        <h2 className="mb-6">
          Because Here's the Truth:
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-8 text-xl">
          Most people teaching business are lying.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Not maliciously.<br />
          Just... ignorantly.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          They think they're helping you.<br />
          But what they're really doing is handing you tools from Level 9...

        <p className="mb-8">
          ...while you're still stuck on Level 1, wondering what button makes your character move.

        <p className="mb-8">
          And it's not your fault.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Because you never had a rich mentor.<br />
          You didn't grow up watching Shark Tank.<br />
          You weren't raised by an ex-Google executive who taught you business over brunch.<br />
          You're a real human being â€” in Nigeria. Or Ghana. Or Kenya. Or whatever country with power outages and expensive internet.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          And the "starter kits" you see online?

          "Sell digital products."<br />
